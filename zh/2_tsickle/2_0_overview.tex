\section{Overview}

% Tsickle is a small utility that carries out transformations on TypeScript code to make it
% suitable as input for the Closure Compiler, which in turn is used to generate highly
% optimized JavaScript code.

% The home for the Tsickle project is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/angular/tsickle}
\end{itemize}

% which introduces Tsickle as:

% \emph{“Tsickle converts TypeScript code into a form acceptable to the Closure}
% \emph{Compiler. This allows using TypeScript to transpile your sources, and then}
% \emph{using Closure Compiler to bundle and optimize them, while taking}
% \emph{advantage of type information in Closure Compiler.”}

% Tsickle is used Angular but can also be used by non-Angular projects.

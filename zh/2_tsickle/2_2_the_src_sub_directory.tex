\section{The src Sub-Directory}

The src sub-directory contains the following source files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item class\_decorator\_downlevel\_transformer.ts
  \item cli\_support.ts
  \item closure\_externs.js
  \item decorator-annotator.ts
  \item decorators.ts
  \item es5processor.ts
  \item fileoverview\_comment\_transformer.ts
  \item jsdoc.ts
  \item main.ts
  \item modules\_manifest.ts
  \item rewriter.ts
  \item source\_map\_utils.ts
  \item transformer\_sourcemap.ts
  \item transformer\_util.ts
  \item tsickle.ts
  \item type-translator.ts
  \item util.ts
\end{itemize}

main.ts is where the call to tsickle starts executing and tsickle.ts is where the core
logic is – the other files are helpers.

The entry point at the bottom of main.ts calls the main function passing in the
argument list as an array of strings.

\input{2_tsickle/code/2_2_0.tex}

The main function first loads the settings
1
from the args and
2
the tsc config. Then it
calls the
\texttt{toClosureJs()}
function
3
, and outputs to a file
4
each resulting JavaScript
file. If
\texttt{externsPath}
is set in settings, they too are written out to files
5
.

The
\texttt{loadSettingsfromArgs()}
function handles the command-line arguments, which
can be a mix of tsickle-specific arguments and regular tsc arguments. The tsickle-
specific arguments are –externs (generate externs file) and –untyped (every
TypeScript type becomes a Closure {?} type).

The
\texttt{toClosureJs()}
function is where the transformation occurs. It returns
1
a map of
transformed file contents, optionally with externs information, it so configured.

\input{2_tsickle/code/2_2_1.tex}

It first creates
1
a compiler host based on the supplied options, then
2
it uses
TypeScript’s
\texttt{createProgram}
method with the original program source to ensure it is
syntatically correct and any error messages refer the original source, not the modified
source. Then it creates
\texttt{3}
a
\texttt{tsickle.TsickleHost}
instance which it passes
\texttt{4}
to
\texttt{tsickle.emitWithTsickle()}
.

The
\texttt{annotate}
function is a simple function:

\input{2_tsickle/code/2_2_2.tex}

Classes called rewriters are used to rewrite the source. The rewriter.ts file has the
\texttt{Rewriter}
abstract class. An important method is
\texttt{maybeProcess()}
.

\input{2_tsickle/code/2_2_3.tex}

tsickle.ts has some classes that derive from
\texttt{Rewriter}
, according to this hierarchy:

\texttt{Annotator.maybeProcess()}
is where the actual rewriting occurs.
Annotator
ClosureRewriter
Rewriter

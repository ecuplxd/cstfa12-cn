\section{Source Tree Layout}

% The Tsickle source tree has these sub-directories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item src
  \item test
  \item test\_files
  \item third\_party
\end{itemize}

% The main directory has these important files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item readme.md
  \item package.json
  \item gulpfile.js
  \item tsconfig.json
\end{itemize}

% The readme.md contains useful information about the project, including this important
% guidance about the use of tsconfig.json:

% \emph{Tsickle works by wrapping tsc. To use it, you must set up your project such}
% \emph{that it builds correctly when you run tsc from the command line, by}
% \emph{configuring the settings in tsconfig.json.}

% \emph{If you have complicated tsc command lines and flags in a build file (like a}
% \emph{gulpfile etc.) Tsickle won't know about it. Another reason it's nice to put}
% \emph{everything in tsconfig.json is so your editor inherits all these settings as}
% \emph{well.}

% The package.json file contains:

\input{2_tsickle/code/2_1_0.tex}

% The gulpfile.js file contains the following Gulp tasks:

\begin{itemize}
  \item gulp format
  \item gulp test.check-format (formatting tests)
  \item gulp test.check-lint (run tslint)
\end{itemize}

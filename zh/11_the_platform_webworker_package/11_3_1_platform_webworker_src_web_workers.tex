\subsection{platform-webworker/src/web\_workers}

% The source files for web\_workers are provided in three sub-directories, one of which
% has shared messaging functionality use both by the UI side and worker side and the
% communication, the second refers only to the UI side and the third only to the worker
% side.

\begin{itemize}
  \item shared/api.ts
  \item shared/client\_message\_broker.ts
  \item shared/message\_bus.ts
  \item shared/messaging\_api.ts
  \item shared/post\_message\_bus.ts
  \item shared/render\_store.ts
  \item shared/serializer.ts
  \item shared/service\_message\_broker.ts
  \item ui/event\_dispatcher.ts
  \item ui/event\_serializer.ts
  \item ui/location\_providers.ts
  \item ui/platform\_location.ts
  \item ui/renderer.ts
  \item worker/location\_providers.ts
  \item worker/platform\_location.ts
  \item worker/renderer.ts
  \item worker/worker\_adapter.ts
\end{itemize}

% Communication between the UI thread and the webworker is handled by a low-level
% multi-channel message bus. The shared/messaging\_api.ts file defines the names of
% the three channels used by Angular:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_0.tex}

% If you are familiar with TCP/IP, the channel name here serves the same purpose as a
% port number – it is needed to multiplex multiple independent message streams on a
% single data connection. Note the 2 in the names. This means these channels are for
% the updated renderer architecture.

% The message\_bus.ts file defines an abstract
% \texttt{MessageBus}
% class and two interfaces,
% \texttt{MessageBusSource}
% and
% \texttt{MessageBusSink}
% . Let’s look at the interfaces first.
% \texttt{MessageBusSource}
% is for incoming messages. This interface describes the functionality
% a message source is expected to supply. It has methods to initialize a channel based
% MessageBus
% MessageBusSource
% MessageBusSink

% on a string name, to attach to a zone, and to return an RxJS observable
% (
% \texttt{EventEmitter}
% ) that can be observed in order to read the incoming messages.

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_1.tex}

% Similarly,
% \texttt{MessageBusSink}
% is for outgoing messages. Again it allows a named channel
% to be initialized, attacing to a zone and returns a RxJS observer (
% \texttt{EventEmitter}
% ) used
% to send messages:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_2.tex}

% \texttt{MessageBus}
% is an abstract class that implements both
% \texttt{MessageBusSource}
% and
% \texttt{MessageBusSink}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_3.tex}

% So far the message bus description has only specified what the functionality that
% needs to be supplied. A single implementation is supplied, in post\_message\_bus.ts,
% based on the
% \texttt{postMessage}
% API. This defines three classes,
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSource}
% ,
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSink}
% and
% \texttt{PostMessageBus}
% , that implement the above similarly
% named types.

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_4.tex}

% A useful private class is supplied called
% \texttt{\_Channel}
% that keeps track of two pieces of
% data:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_5.tex}

% Channels are initialized with
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSource.initChannel()}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_6.tex}

% So we see a channel is nothing more that a name that maps to a
% \texttt{\_Channel}
% , which is
% just an
% \texttt{EventEmitter}
% and a boolean (
% \texttt{runInZone}
% ).
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSource}
% manages
% a map of these called \_channels:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_7.tex}

% The
% \texttt{from()}
% method just returns the appropriate channel emitter:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_8.tex}

% The constructor calls
% \texttt{addEventListener}
% to add an event listener:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_9.tex}

% The
% \texttt{\_handleMessages}
% function passes on each message to the
% \texttt{\_handleMessage}
% function, which emits it on the approapriate channel:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_10.tex}

% The
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSink}
% implementation is slightly different because it needs to use
% \texttt{postMessageTarget}
% to post messages. Its constructor creates a field based on the
% supplied
% \texttt{PostMessageTarget}
% parameter:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_11.tex}

% The
% \texttt{initChannel}
% method subscribes to the emitter with a next handler that either
% (when runnign inside the Angular zone) adds the message to the
% \texttt{messageBuffer}
% where its sending is deferred, or (if running outside the Angular zone), calls
% \texttt{\_sendMessages}
% , to immediately send the message:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_12.tex}

% \texttt{\_sendMessages()}
% just sends the message array via
% \texttt{PostMessageTarget}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_13.tex}

% So we saw with
% \texttt{initChannel}
% that the subscription to the emitter either calls
% \texttt{\_sendMessages}
% immediately or parks the message in a message buffer, for later
% transmission. So two questions arise – what triggers that transmission and how does
% it work. Well, to answer the second question first,
% \texttt{\_sendMessages}
% is also called for the
% bulk transmission, from inside the
% \texttt{\_handleOnEventDone}
% message:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_14.tex}

% So, what calls
% \texttt{\_handleOnEventDone}
% ? Let’s digress to look at the
% \texttt{NgZone}
% class in

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{fix: href loss url}
        {fix: href loss url}
\end{itemize}

% which has this getter:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_15.tex}

% So when the zone has no more work to immediately carry out, it emits a message via
% \texttt{onStable}
% . Back to
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSink}
% – which has this code, that subscribes to the
% \texttt{onStable}
% event emitter:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_16.tex}

% With all the hard work done in
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSource}
% and
% \texttt{PostMessageBusSink}
% , the
% implementation of
% \texttt{PostMessageBus}
% is quite simple:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_17.tex}

% A different way of looking at the message bus is as a set of independent channels:

% In summary, the message bus in Angular is a simple efficient messaging passing
% mechanism with web workers. It is based on a single connection, with opaque
% messages consisting of a channel name (string) and message data:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_18.tex}

% Angular also supplies a richer message broker layered above this simple message bus.
% UI main thread
% Web Worker
% Communicating Over The Message Bus (actual)

% Communicating Over The Message Bus (conceptual)

% The files client\_message\_broker.ts and service\_message\_broker.ts along with a
% number of helper files for serialization implement the message broker.

% The service\_message\_broker.ts file defines the
% \texttt{ReceivedMessage}
% class that
% represents a message:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_19.tex}

% The class
% \texttt{ServiceMessageBrokerFactory}
% provide a factory for the service message
% broker:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_20.tex}

% The service message broker is created based on the supplied message bus, serializer
% and channel name. The abstract
% \texttt{ServiceMessageBroker}
% class contains just one
% ClientMessageBroker
% ServiceMessageBroker

% abstract class declaration,
% \texttt{registerMethod}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_21.tex}

% It has two private fields, an event emitter
% \texttt{\_sink}
% and a map from string to function
% \texttt{\_methods}
% . In its constructor it subscribes its internal method
% \texttt{\_ handleMessage}
% to
% \texttt{messageBus.from}
% (this handles incoming messages), and set
% \texttt{\_sink}
% to
% \texttt{messageBus.to}
% (this will be used to send messages).

% \texttt{\_handleMessage()}
% message creates a
% \texttt{ReceivedMessage}
% based on the map
% parameter, and then if message.method is listed as a supported message in
% \texttt{\_methods}
% , looks up
% \texttt{\_methods}
% for the appropriate function to execute, to handle the
% message:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_22.tex}

% The next question is how methods get registered in \_methods. That is the job of
% \texttt{registerMethod()}
% , whose implementation adds an entry to the
% \texttt{\_methods}
% map based
% on the supplied parameters. Its key is the
% \texttt{methodName}
% supplied as a parameter and its
% value is an anonymous method, with a single parameter, message, of type
% \texttt{ReceivedMessage}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_23.tex}

% We see at its
% 1
% deserialization occuring with the help of the serializer, and at
% 2
% method is called with the deserialized arguments, and at
% 3
% we see if a returnType is
% needed, \_ wrapWebWorkerPromise is called, to handle the then of the promise, which
% emits the result to the sink:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_24.tex}

% The client side of this messaging relationship is handled by client\_message\_broker.ts.
% It defines some simple helper types:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_25.tex}

% To construct a client message borker it defines the
% \texttt{ClientMessageBrokerFactory}
% which, in its
% \texttt{createMessageBroker}
% method, calls
% \texttt{initChannel}
% on the message bus
% and returns a new
% \texttt{ClientMessageBroker}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_26.tex}

% \texttt{ClientMessageBroker}
% has an important method to run on service, which calls a
% method with the supplied
% \texttt{UiArguments}
% on the remote service side and returns a
% promise with the return value (if any).
% \texttt{ClientMessageBroker}
% is implemented as
% follows:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_27.tex}

% It has three fields,
% \texttt{\_pending}
% ,
% \texttt{\_sink}
% and
% \texttt{\_serializer}
% .
% \texttt{\_pending}
% is a map from string
% to
% \texttt{PromiseCompleter}
% . It is used to keep track of method calls that require a return
% value and are outstanding – the message has been set to the service, and the result is
% awaited. In its constructor
% \texttt{\_sink}
% is set to the
% \texttt{messageBus.to}
% and serializer set to the
% \texttt{Serializer}
% parameter. Also a source subscription is set for
% \texttt{\_handleMessage}
% .

% Messages for which a return value is expected have a message id generated for them
% via:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_28.tex}

% It is this string that is the key into the \_pending map. We will now see how it is set up
% in
% \texttt{runOnService}
% and used in
% \texttt{\_handleMessage}
% .
% \texttt{RunOnService}
% is what the client calls
% when it wants the service to execute a method. It returns a promise, which is a return
% value is required, it is completed when the service returns it.
% Let’s first examine
% \texttt{runOnService}
% when
% \texttt{returnType}
% is null. This creates an array of
% serialized arguments in
% \texttt{fnArgs}
% 1
% , sets up an object literal called message with
% properties “method” and “args”
% 2
% , and then calls
% \texttt{\_sink.emit(message)}
% 3
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_29.tex}

% Things are a little more complex when a return value is required. A promise and a
% promise completer are created
% 1
% ;
% \texttt{\_generateMessageId()}
% is called
% 2
% to generate a
% unique message id for this message; an entry is made into
% \texttt{\_pending}
% 3
% , whose key is
% the id and whose value is the promise completer. The then of the promise
% 4
% returns
% the result
% 5a
% (deserialized if needed
% 5b
% ). Before the message is sent via
% \texttt{sink.emit}
% ,
% the generated message id is attached to the message
% 6
% .

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_30.tex}

% The
% \texttt{\_handleMessage}
% accepts a
% \texttt{ResponseMessageData}
% parameter. It extracts
% 1
% the
% message id, which it uses to look up
% \texttt{\_pending}
% 2
% for the promise. If message data has
% a result field, this is used in a call to the
% \texttt{promise.resolve}
% 3
% , otherwise
% \texttt{promise.reject}
% 4
% is called:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_31.tex}

% Two helper files are involved with serialization – render\_store.ts and serializer.ts. The
% \texttt{RenderStore}
% class, define in render\_store.ts, manages two maps – the first,
% \texttt{\_lookupById}
% , from number to any, and the second,
% \texttt{lookupByObject}
% , from any to
% number. It supplies methods to store and remove objects and serialize and de-
% serialize them.

% The
% \texttt{Serializer}
% class is defined in serializer.ts and has methods to serialize and
% deserialize. The
% \texttt{serialize}
% method is:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_32.tex}

% Based on the type an appropriate serialization helper method is called.

% The last file in the shared directory is api.ts, which has this one line:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_33.tex}

% It is used to store a boolean value with dependency injection, stating whether the
% current code is running in a webworker or not. At this point it would be helpful to
% review how shared functionality is actually configured with dependency injection. On
% the worker side:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-webworker/src/worker_app.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-webworker/src/worker\_app.ts}
\end{itemize}

% has this:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_34.tex}

% Note
% \texttt{ON\_WEB\_WORKER}
% is set to true.

% On the ui main thread side:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-webworker/src/worker_render.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-webworker/src/worker\_render.ts}
\end{itemize}

% has this:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_35.tex}

% Note
% \texttt{ON\_WEB\_WORKER}
% is set to false.

% Now we will move on to looking at the worker-specific code in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/platform-webworker/src/web_workers}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-webworker/src/web\_workers}
\end{itemize}

% In worker\_adapter.ts,
% \texttt{WorkerDomAdapter}
% extends
% \texttt{DomAdapter}
% but only implements
% the logging functionality – for everything else an exception is raised.
% \texttt{WorkerDomAdapter}
% is not how workers render, instead is just logs data to the console.

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_36.tex}

% The renderer.ts file supplies the
% \texttt{WebWorkerRendererFactory2}
% and
% \texttt{WebWorkerRenderer2}
% classes and this is where worker-based rendering is managed.

% \texttt{WebWorkerRenderer2}
% implements the Renderer API and forwards all calls to
% runOnService from the root renderer.
% \texttt{WebWorkerRenderer2}
% is running the webworker
% where there is no DOM, so any rendering needs to be forwarded to the main UI
% thread, and that is what
% \texttt{runOnService}
% is doing here.

% This is a sampling of the calls:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_37.tex}

% \texttt{WebWorkerRendererFactory2}
% implements Core’s
% \texttt{RendererFactory2}
% by setting up the
% client message broker factory.

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_38.tex}

% An additional and very important role of
% \texttt{WebWorkerRendererFactory2}
% is to configure
% event handling. We see at
% 1
% \texttt{initChannel()}
% being called for the
% \texttt{EVENT\_2\_CHANNEL}
% , at
% 2
% the message source being accessed, and at
% 3
% a subscription being set up with the
% \texttt{\_dispatchEvent()}
% method, which is implemented as:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_39.tex}

% The ui specific code is in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/platform-webworker/src/web_workers/ui}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-webworker/src/web\_workers/ui}
\end{itemize}

% The renderer.ts file implements the
% \texttt{MessageBasedRenderer2}
% class. Note this class,
% despite its name, does not implement any types from Core’s rendering API. Instead, it
% accepts a
% \texttt{RendererFactory2}
% instance as a constructor parameter, and forwards all
% rendering requests to it. Its constructor also has a few other parameters which it uses
% as fields and it also defines one extra, an
% \texttt{EventDispatcher}
% .

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_40.tex}

% Its
% \texttt{start()}
% method initializes the
% \texttt{EVENT\_2\_CHANNEL}
% , creates a new
% \texttt{EventDispatcher}
% , and then has a very long list of calls to
% \texttt{registerMethod}
% – when
% such messages are received, then the configured local method is called. Here is a
% short selection of the
% \texttt{registerMethod}
% calls:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_41.tex}

% The local methods usually call the equivalent method in the configured renderer, and
% often stores the result in the
% \texttt{RenderStore}
% . Here is
% \texttt{\_createElement()}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_42.tex}

% For event listening, the event dispatcher is used:

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_43.tex}

% The
% \texttt{EventDispatcher}
% class is defined in event\_dispatcher.ts and has a constructor
% and one method,
% \texttt{dispatchRenderEvent()}
% :

\input{../output/11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_1_44.tex}

% The switch in the middle is a long list of all the supported events and appropriate calls
% to an event serializer. Above we show what is has for keyboard events.

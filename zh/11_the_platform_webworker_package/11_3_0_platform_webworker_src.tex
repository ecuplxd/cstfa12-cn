\subsection{platform-webworker/src}

% In addition to the export files, this directory contains the following files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item worker\_app.ts
  \item worker\_render.ts
\end{itemize}

% worker\_app.ts supplies functionality for an application that runs in a worker and
% worker\_render.ts supplies functionality for the the main UI thread. They communicate
% via a message broker layered above a simple message bus.

% A web worker cannot use the DOM directly in a web browser. Therefore Angular’s
% Platform-WebWorker creates a message bus between the web worker and the main UI
% thread and rendering (and event processing) takes place over this message bus.

% The
% \texttt{platformWorkerApp}
% const creates a platform factory for a worker app:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_0.tex}

% Two important helper functions are supplied.
% \texttt{createMessageBus}
% creates the message
% bus that will supply communications between the main UI thread and the web worker:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_1.tex}

% \texttt{setupWebWorker}
% makes the web worker’s DOM adapter implementation as the current
% DOM adapter. The DOM renderer is used both for apps running in a normal browser UI
% thread and apps running in web workers. What is different is the DOM adapter – for a
% browser UI thread, the DOM adapter just maps to the underlying browser DOM API.
% There is no underlying DOM API in a web worker. So for an app running in a web
% worker, the worker DOM adapter needs to forward all DOM actions across the
% message bus to the browser’s main UI thread.

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_2.tex}

% Finally, the
% \texttt{NgModule}
% is defined:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_3.tex}

% The worker\_render.ts file has implementations for the worker UI. This runs in the
% main UI thread and uses the
% \texttt{BrowserDomAdapter}
% , which writes to the underlying DOM
% API of the browser.
% \texttt{platformWorkerUi}
% represents a platform factory:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_4.tex}

% The providers used are as followed:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_5.tex}

% Note the provider configuration for
% \texttt{WORKER\_UI\_STARTABLE\_MESSAGING\_SERVICE}
% is set
% to multi - thus allowing multiple messaging services to be started. Also note that
% \texttt{initWebWorkerRenderPlatform}
% is registered as a
% \texttt{PLATFORM\_INITIALIZER}
% , so it is
% going to be called when the platform launches.

% \texttt{WebWorkerInstance}
% is a simple injectable class representing the web worker and its
% message bus (note the
% \texttt{init}
% method just initializes the two fields):

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_6.tex}

% Now let’s look at
% \texttt{initWebWorkerRenderPlatform}
% :

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_7.tex}

% It returns a function that makes the browser Dom adatper the current adapter
% 1
% ; then
% gets the worker script from di
% 2
% ; then calls
% \texttt{spawnWebWorker}
% 3
% ; and finally calls
% \texttt{initializeGenericWorkerRenderer}
% 4
% . The
% \texttt{spawnWebWorker}
% function is defined as:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_8.tex}

% It first creates a new web worker
% 1
% ; then it create the message bus with its sinka dn
% source
% 2
% and finally it calls
% \texttt{WebWorkerInstance.init}
% 3
% which we have already seen.
% The
% \texttt{initializeGenericWorkerRenderer}
% function is defined as:

\input{11_the_platform_webworker_package/code/11_3_0_9.tex}

% It first asks the dependency injector for a message bus and a zone and attached the
% bus to the zone. Then it also asks the dependency injector for a list of
% \texttt{WORKER\_UI\_STARTABLE\_MESSAGING\_SERVICE}
% (remember we noted it was configured as
% a multi provider), and for each service, starts it.

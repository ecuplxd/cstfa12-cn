\subsection{zone.ts}

The first six hundred lines of the zone.ts file is the well-commented definition of the
Zone.js API, that will end up in zone.d.ts. The slightly larger remainder of the file is an
implementation of the
\texttt{Zone}
const:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_0.tex}

The
\texttt{\_ZonePrivate}
interface defines private information that is managed per zone:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_1.tex}

When using the client API you will not see this, but when debugging through the
Zone.js implementation, it will crop up from time to time.

A microtask queue is managed, which requries these variables:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_2.tex}

\texttt{\_microTaskQueue}
is an array of microtasks, that must be executed before we give up
our VM turn.
\texttt{\_isDrainingMicrotaskQueue}
is a boolean that tracks if we are in the
process of emptying the microtask queue. When a task is run within an existing task,
they are nested and
\texttt{\_nativeMicroTaskQueuePromise}
is used to access a native
microtask queue. Which is stored as a global is not set. Two functions manage a
microtask queue:

\begin{itemize}
  \item scheduleMicroTask
  \item drainMicroTaskQueue
\end{itemize}

It also implements three classes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Zone
  \item ZoneDelegate
  \item ZoneTask
\end{itemize}

There are no implementations of
\texttt{ZoneSpec}
in this file. They are in the separate zone-
spec sub-directory.

\texttt{ZoneTask}
is the simplest of these classes:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_3.tex}

The constructor just records the supplied parameters and sets up
\texttt{invoke}
:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_4.tex}

The interesting activity in here is setting up the
\texttt{invoke}
function. It increments the
\texttt{\_numberOfNestedTaskFrames}
counter, calls
\texttt{zone.runTask()}
, and in a
\texttt{finally}
block,
checks if
\texttt{\_numberOfNestedTaskFrames}
is 1, and if so, calls  the standalone function
\texttt{drainMicroTaskQueue()}
, and then decrements
\texttt{\_numberOfNestedTaskFrames}
.

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_5.tex}

A custom
\texttt{toString()}
implementation returns
\texttt{data.handleId}
(if available) or else the
object’s
\texttt{toString()}
result:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_6.tex}

\texttt{drainMicroTaskQueue()}
is defined as:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_7.tex}

The
\texttt{\_microTaskQueue}
gets populated via a call to
\texttt{scheduleMicroTask}
:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_8.tex}

If needed (not running in a task), this calls
\texttt{setTimeout}
with timeout set to 0, to
enqueue a request to drain the microtask queue. Even though the timeout is 0, this
does not mean that the
\texttt{drainMicroTaskQueue()}
call will execute immediately.
Instead, this puts an event in the JavaScript’s event queue, which after the already
scheduled events have been handled (there may be one or move already in the
queue), will itself be handled. The currently executing function will first run to
completion before any event is removed from the event queue. Hence in the above
code, where
\texttt{scheduleQueueDrain()}
is called before
\texttt{\_microTaskQueue.push()}
, is not
a problem.
\texttt{\_microTaskQueue.push()}
will execute first, and then sometime in future,
the
\texttt{drainMicroTaskQueue()}
function will be called via the timeout.

The
\texttt{ZoneDelegate}
class has to handle eight scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
  \item fork
  \item intercept
  \item invoke
  \item handleError
  \item scheduleTask
  \item invokeTask
  \item cancelTask
  \item hasTask
\end{itemize}

It defines variables to store values for a
\texttt{ZoneDelegate}
and
\texttt{ZoneSpec}
for each of
these, which are initialized in the constructor.

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_9.tex}

\texttt{ZoneDelegate}
also declares three variables, to store the delegates zone and parent
delegate, and to represent task counts (for each kind of task):

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_10.tex}

In
\texttt{ZoneDelegate}
’s constructor, the
\texttt{zone}
and
\texttt{parentDelegate}
fields are initialized to
the supplied parameters, and the
\texttt{ZoneDelegate}
and
\texttt{ZoneSpec}
fields for the eight
scenarios are set (using TypeScript type guards), either to the supplied
\texttt{ZoneSpec}
(if
not null), or the parent delegate’s:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_11.tex}

The
\texttt{ZoneDelegate}
methods for the eight scenarios just forward the calls to the
selected
\texttt{ZoneSpec}
(pr parent delegate) and does some house keeping. For example,
the invoke method checks if
\texttt{\_invokeZS}
is defined, and if so, calls its
\texttt{onInvoke}
,
otherwise it calls the supplied callback directly:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_12.tex}

The
\texttt{scheduleTask}
method is a bit different, in that it first
1
tries to use the
\texttt{\_scheduleTaskZS}
(if defined), otherwise
2
tries to use the supplied task’s
\texttt{scheduleFn}
(if defined), otherwise
3
if a microtask calls
\texttt{scheduleMicroTask()}
, otherwise
4
it is
an error:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_13.tex}

The fork method is where new zones get created. If
\texttt{\_forkZS}
is defined, it is used,
otherwise a new zone is created with the supplied
\texttt{targetZone}
and
\texttt{zoneSpec}
:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_14.tex}

The internal variable
\texttt{\_currentZoneFrame}
is initialized to the root zone and
\texttt{\_currentTask}
to null:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_4_0_15.tex}

\subsection{Use Within Angular}

% When writing Angular applications, all your application code runs within a zone, unless
% you take specific steps to ensure some of it does not. Also, most of the Angular
% framework code itself runs in a zone. When beginning Angular application
% development, you can get by simply ignoring zones, since they are set up correctly by
% default for you and applications do not have to do anything in particular to take
% advantage of them. The end of the file
% \href{https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/master/MODULE.md}
% {<ZONE-MASTER>/blob/master/MODULE.md}
% explains where Angular uses zones:

% \emph{“Angular uses zone.js to manage async operations and decide when to perform}
% \emph{change detection. Thus, in Angular, the following APIs should be patched, otherwise}
% \emph{Angular may not work as expected.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item ZoneAwarePromise
  \item timer
  \item on\_property
  \item EventTarget
  \item XHR”
\end{itemize}

% Zones are how Angular initiates change detection – when the zone’s mini-stack is
% empty, change detection occurs. Also, zones are how Angular configures global
% exception handlers. When an error occurs in a task, its zone’s configured error handler
% is called. A default implementation is provided and applications can supply a custom
% implementation via dependency injection. For details, see here:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://angular.io/api/core/ErrorHandler}
\end{itemize}

% On that page note the code sample about setting up your own error handler:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_0_0.tex}

% Angular provide a class,
% \texttt{NgZone}
% , which builds on zones:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://angular.io/api/core/NgZone}
\end{itemize}

% As you begin to create more advanced Angular applications, specifically those
% involving computationally intensive code that does not change the UI midway through
% the computation (but may at the end), you will see it is desirable to place such CPU-
% intensive work in a separate zone, and you would use a custom
% \texttt{NgZone}
% for that.

% Elsewhere we will be looking in detail at
% \texttt{NgZone}
% and the use of zones within Angular in
% general when we explore the source tree for the main Angular project later, but for
% now, note the source for
% \texttt{NgZone}
% is in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/core/src/zone}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/zone}
\end{itemize}

% and the zone setup during bootstrap for an application is in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/application_ref.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/application\_ref.ts}
\end{itemize}

% When we bootstrap our Angular applications, we either use
% \texttt{bootstrapModule<M>}
% (using the dynamic compiler) or
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory<M>}
% (using the offline
% compiler). Both these functions are in application\_ref.ts.
% \texttt{bootstrapModule<M>}
% calls
% the Angular compiler
% 1
% and then calls
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory<M>}
% \texttt{2}
% \texttt{.}

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_0_1.tex}

% It is in
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory}
% we see how zones are initialized for Angular:

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_0_2.tex}

% At
% 1
% we see a new
% \texttt{NgZone}
% being created and at
% 2
% its
% \texttt{run()}
% method being called, at
% 3
% we see an error handler implementation being requested from dependency injection (a
% default implementation will be returned unless the application supplies a custom one)
% and at
% 4
% , we see that error handler being used to configure error handling for the
% newly created
% \texttt{NgZone}
% . Finally at
% 5
% , we see the call to the actual bootstrapping.

% So in summary, Angular application developers should clearly learn about zones, since
% that is the execution context within which their application code will run.

\section{Using Zone.js}

% Before looking in detail at how Zone.js itself is implemented, we will first look at how
% it is used in production, using the example of the very popular Angular project.

% The use of Zone.js with Angular is optional, but used by default. Use of zones is
% mostly a good idea but there are some scenarios (e.g. using Angular Elements to build
% Web Compoenents) when this is not the case.

% To use Zone.js in your applications, you need to load it. Your package.json file will
% need (if creating a project using Angular CLI, this is added automatically for you):

\input{../output/1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_0.tex}

% You should load Zone.js after loading core.js (if using that). For example, if using an
% Angular application generated via Angular CLI (as most production apps will be),
% Angular CLI will generate a file called <project-name>/src/polyfills.ts and it will
% contain:

\input{../output/1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_1.tex}

% Angular CLI also generates an angular.json configuration file, with this line that sets
% up polyfills:

\input{../output/1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_2.tex}

% If writing your application in TypeScript (recommended), you also need to get access
% to the ambient declarations. These define the Zone.js API and are supplied in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/zone.js/blob/master/dist/zone.js.d.ts}
        {<ZONE-MASTER>/dist/zone.js.d.ts}
\end{itemize}

% (IMPORTANT: This file is particularly well documented and well worth some careful
% study by those learning Zone.js). Unlike declarations for most other libraries,
% zone.js.d.ts does not use
% \texttt{import}
% or
% \texttt{export}
% at all (those constructs do not appear
% even once in that file). That means application code wishing to use zones cannot
% simply import its .d.ts file, as is normally the case. Instead, the
% \texttt{///reference}
% construct needs to be used. This includes the referenced file at the site of the
% \texttt{///reference}
% in the containing file. The benefit of this approach is that the containing
% file itself does not have to (but may) use
% \texttt{import}
% , and thus may be a script, rather
% than having to be a module. The use of zones is not forcing the application to use
% modules (however, most larger applications, including all Angular applications - will).
% How this works is best examined with an example, so lets look at how Angular
% includes zone.d.ts. Angular contains a file, types.d.ts under its packages directory
% (and a similar one under its modules directory and tools directory):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/types.d.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/types.d.ts}
\end{itemize}

% and it has the following contents:

\input{../output/1_internals_of_zone_js/code/1_1_3.tex}

\input{1_internals_of_zone_js/1_1_0_use_within_angular.tex}

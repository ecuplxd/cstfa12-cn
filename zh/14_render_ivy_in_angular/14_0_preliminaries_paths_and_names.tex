\section{Preliminaries – Paths and names}

This document is a guided tour of the new “Ivy” rendering functionality within the
modern Angular source tree. We mostly look at the main Angular repository (paths
within which we prefix with ANGULAR-MASTER) and also have some discussion of the
Angular CLI repository (paths within which we prefix with ANGULAR-CLI-MASTER).
You may wish to clone these repositories to your local machine or you may wish to
refer to them on Github. If the latter, you should expand these placeholders to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item ANGULAR-MASTER - https://github.com/angular/angular
  \item ANGUALR-CLI-MASTER - https://github.com/angular/angular-cli
\end{itemize}

We like to use the name “Render3” (instead of “Render 3” with a space), as it helps
with Google search, etc. The code-name for this is “Ivy”, we will see that used in
places in the code and with the new
\texttt{enableIvy}
option for Compiler-CLI, which can be
added via Angular CLI’s
\texttt{ng new}
command, as described here:

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

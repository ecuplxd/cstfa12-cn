\subsection{Interfaces}

When trying to figure out how Render3 works, a good place to start is with its
interfaces. Let’s look at this first:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render3/interfaces/renderer.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/render3/interfaces/renderer.ts}
\end{itemize}

There are some simple helper interfaces describing a node, an element and a text
node. The node is defined as have three methods to insert, append and remove a
child:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_0.tex}

The element allows adding and removing of listeners, working with attributes and
properties and style configuration – it is defined as:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_1.tex}

The text node adds a
\texttt{textContent}
property:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_2.tex}

It has this factory code. Note the return type from
\texttt{createRenderer}
is
\texttt{Render3}
1
–
and that for the
\texttt{domRendererFactory3}
implementation
2
this is the normal DOM
\texttt{document}
:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_3.tex}

This is key to moving back to regular DOM usage for code that runs in the main
browser UI thread, and yet allowing alternatives elsewhere.
\texttt{Renderer3}
is a type alias:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_4.tex}

This represents the two kinds of renderers that are supported. The bolded text in the
comment highlights the usage scenario for the first of these:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_5.tex}

\texttt{ProceduralRender3}
is intended to be used from web workers and server-side:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_6.tex}

Let’s now look at
\url{view.ts}
. It includes the following to work with static data:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_7.tex}

\texttt{TData}
is defined as:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_8.tex}

A tree of
\texttt{LView}
s or
\texttt{LContainer}
s will be needed, so this type is a node in the
hierarchy:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_9.tex}

An LView stores info relating to processing a view’s instructions. Detailed comments
(not shown here) for each of its fields are in
\url{thesource}
.

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_10.tex}

The
\url{container.ts}
file looks at containers, which are collections of views and sub-
containers. It exports one type,
\texttt{TContainer}
:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_11.tex}

and one interface,
\texttt{LContainer}
: (note
\url{thesourcefile}
contained detailed comments for
each field):

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_12.tex}

The
\url{query.ts}
file contains the
\texttt{QueryReadType}
class:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_13.tex}

and the
\texttt{LQuery}
interface:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_14.tex}

The
\url{projection.ts}
file define LProjection as:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_15.tex}

The injector.ts file has this:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_16.tex}

The node.ts file is large and contains a hierarchy of node-related types.

The root,
\texttt{LNode}
, is defined (abbreviated) as:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_5_2_17.tex}

Each of the other types adds a few additional fields to represent that node type.

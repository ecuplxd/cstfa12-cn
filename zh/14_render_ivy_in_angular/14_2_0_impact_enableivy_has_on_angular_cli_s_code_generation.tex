\subsection{Impact enableIvy has on Angular CLI’s code generation}

% To best see the differences the
% \texttt{enableIvy}
% option has on code generation, we will now
% create two new projects – one with and one without the
% \texttt{--enableIvy}
% option. To save
% us some time we will use the
% \texttt{–-skipInstall}
% option, which means npm install is not
% run to download all the dependency packages.

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_2_0_0.tex}

% A search for
% \texttt{ivy}
% in the generated render2 codebase reveals no hits, as expected. A
% search for
% \texttt{ivy}
% in the render3 codebase reveals 2 hits. In package.json,
% \texttt{scripts}
% has
% this additional item:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_2_0_1.tex}

% and in tsconfig.app.json,
% \texttt{angularCompilerOptions}
% has this entry:

\input{14_render_ivy_in_angular/code/14_2_0_2.tex}

% Now that we have seen how Angular CLI adds enableIvy, we are ready to move on to
% explore how Compiler CLI detects and reacts to this.

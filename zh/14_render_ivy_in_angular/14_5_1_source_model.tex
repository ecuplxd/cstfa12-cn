% It could be said Render3 is a re-imagining of what rendering means for an Angular
% application. The principal change is that the DOM comes back as the main API that is
% used to render, and the idea of custom renderers goes away. In scenarios where the
% DOM does not exist (such as a web worker or on the server), then a polyfill DOM will
% be needed.

% In some pieces of Render3 code, we see use of the ‘L’ and ‘R’ prefixes. This is
% explained in a comment in the source:

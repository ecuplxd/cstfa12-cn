% RxJS is a wonderful framework to handle observable streams of items. We see its use
% in Angular as event emitters, HTTP responses and services. To become a good Angular
% developer you first have to become a good RxJS developer. It is that critical to the
% correct programming of Angular. RxJS is also the base technology for NgRx, the very
% popular state cache engine for client apps.

% An observable is a dual of an enumerable. With an enumerable, your code would
% call .next() repeatable to get the next item in a sequence. In contrast, with an
% observable, you supply one method to handle new data items, and optionally a
% method to handle errors and another to handle the completion event (successful end
% of items). The internals of the observable will call your code when it has data items to
% deliver to you. So you could imagine a HTTP request being sent to the server, and a
% blob of data coming back in multiple packets. As more items come in, the observable
% will call the handler in your code to process them.

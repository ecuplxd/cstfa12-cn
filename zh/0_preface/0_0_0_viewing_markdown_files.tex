\subsection{Viewing Markdown Files}

% In addition to source in TypeScript, all these projects also contain documentation files
% in markdown format (*.md). Markdown is a domain specific language (DSL) for
% represent HTML documents. It is easier / quicker to manually author compared to
% HTML. When transformed to HTML it provides professional documentation. One
% question you might have is how to view them (as HTML, rather that as .md text). One
% easy way to see them as html is just to view the .md files on Github, e.g.:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/angular/angular}
\end{itemize}

% Alternatively, on your own machine, most text editors have either direct markdown
% support or it is available through extensions. When examining a source tree with .md
% files, it is often useful when your code editor can also open markdown files and
% transform them to HTML when requested. StackOverflow covers this issue here:

\end{itemize}

% For example, Visual Studio Code supports Markdown natively and if you open a .md
% file and select CTRL+SHIFT+V, you get to see nice HTML:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown}
\end{itemize}

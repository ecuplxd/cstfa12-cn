\section{Accessing the Source}

% To study the source, you can browse it online, get a copy of the repo via git (usual) or
% download a zip. Some packages may provide extra detail about getting the source –
% for example, for the Angular project, read “Getting the Sources” here:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER.md}
\end{itemize}

% We first need to decide which branch to use. For master, we use this:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master}
\end{itemize}

% Specifically for the Angular main project, an additional way to access the source is in
% the Angular API Reference (
% \url{https://angular.io/api}
% ), the API page for each Angular
% type has a hyperlink at the top of the page to the relevant source file (this resolves to
% the latest stable version, which may or may not be the same source as master).

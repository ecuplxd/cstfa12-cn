\section{An Ecosystem for Modern Web Applications}

% The Angular ecosystem consists of multiple projects that work together to provide a
% comprehensive foundation for developing modern web applications.  With a few
% exceptions, all of these projects are written with TypeScript (even the TypeScript
% compiler is itself written in TypeScript). The exceptions are the Bazel main project
% (which uses Java), fsevents for native access to macOS FSEvents along with the
% Jasmine unit test framework and Karma test runner (all these use JavaScript). The
% dependency on other projects varies.

% Note that the Java-based Bazel main project is used to build Angular itself. Bazel and
% Java are not needed to build regular Angular applications. Bazel is great for
% incremental and multi-core builds so it has advantages when used with large
% codebases (such as Angular itself). In future Bazel is likely to become a sensible build
% option for larger Angular applications.

% None of these projects are dependent on Visual Studio Code. These projects only need
% a code editor that can work with the TypeScript tsc compiler â€“ and there are many -
% see middle of main page at:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{http://typescriptlang.org}
\end{itemize}

% Visual Studio Code is one such editor, that is particularly good, open source, freely
% available for macOS, Linux and Windows, and it too is written in TypeScript.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://code.visualstudio.com}
\end{itemize}

% Of choose you can use any editor to investigate the source trees of these projects.

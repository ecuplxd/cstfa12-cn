\section{Core Render Feature (core/src/render)}

% \emph{Note: There is a new view compliation and rendering architecture  (called}
% \emph{Render3, better known by its code name, Ivy) under intensive development}
% \emph{by the Angular team. A good place to keep an eye on progress and how it is}
% \emph{evolving is:}
% \emph{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/core/src/render3}

% \emph{What we describe below is Render2, which is the current stable view}
% \emph{engine. Please see the appendix for detailed coverage of Render3.}

% Layering for Angular applications involves your application code talking to the Angular
% framework, which is layered into an application layer and a renderer layer, with a
% renderer API in between. The core/src/render/api.ts file defines this thin API and
% nothing else. The API consists of these abstract classes -
% \texttt{RendererType2}
% ,
% \texttt{Renderer2,}
% \texttt{RendererFactory2}
% and
% \texttt{RendererStyleFlags2.}
% Implementation of this API is not
% part of Core. Instead, the various Platform-X packages need to provide the actual
% implementations for different scenarios.

% Scenarios with diverse rendering requirements include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item UI web apps in regular browser
  \item web worker apps
  \item server apps
  \item native apps for mobile devices
  \item testing
\end{itemize}

% The Renderer API is defined in terms of elements – and provides functionality e.g. to
% create elements, set their properties and listen for their events. The Renderer API is
% not defined in terms of a DOM. Indeed, the term “DOM” is not part of any of the
% method names in this API (though it is mentioned in some comments). In that way,
% how rendering is provided is an internal implementation detail, easily replaced in
% different scenarios if needed. Obviously, for a web app running in the main UI thread
% in a regular browser, the platform used for that needs to implement the Renderer API
% in terms of the browser’s DOM (and platform-browser does). But take a web worker
% as an alternative, where there simply is no browser DOM – a different platform needs
% to provide an alternative rendering solution. We will be examining in detail how
% rendering implementations work when we cover platforms later.

% A notable characteristic of the Renderer API is that, even though it is defined in terms
% of elements, it does not list anywhere what those elements are. Elements are
% identified in terms of string names, but what are valid names is not part of the
% renderer. Instead, there is an element schema registry defined in the template
% compiler (
% \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/compiler/src/schema}
% {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/compiler/src/schema}
% ) and we will examine
% it further when looking at the template compiler.

% Now we will move on to looking at the renderer API. This API is exported from the

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/render.ts}
\end{itemize}

% and it contains this export:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0.tex}

% We note a number of the exports have “2” in their name and when we examine the
% actual definitions we see those that do not are deprecated so will will not be covering
% those here. If looking at older documentation you may encounter them, but
% specifically for rendering, for up to date code you should be looking at rendering
% classes with 2 in the name. Also note ‘2’ for rendering is not tied to Angular version 2
% (actually that version of Angular used the older version of the rendering APIs).

% The core/src/render directory has just one file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render/api.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/render/api.ts}
\end{itemize}

% and this contains the rendering definitions we will see used elsewhere by platform-
% implementations.

% \texttt{RendererType2}
% is used to identify component types for which rendering is needed,
% and is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_1.tex}

% The
% \texttt{RendererFactory2}
% class is used to register a provider with dependency injection
% and is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_2.tex}

% Essentially, its main method,
% \texttt{createRenderer()}
% , is used to answer this - “for a given
% host element, please give me back a renderer that I can use”. This is key to wiring up
% flexible rendering of components via dependency injection.

% An example usage is in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-browser/src/browser.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-browser/src/browser.ts}
\end{itemize}

% where
% \texttt{browserModule}
% is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_3.tex}

% Another example usage is in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-webworker/src/worker_app.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-webworker/src/worker\_app.ts}
\end{itemize}

% where
% \texttt{WorkerAppModule}
% is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_4.tex}

% The result of this is that different root renderers can be supplied via dependency
% injection for differing scenarios, and client code using the renderer API can use a
% suitable implementation. If that is how the
% \texttt{RendererFactory2}
% gets into dependency
% injection system, then of course the next question is, how does it get out?

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/view/services.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/view/services.ts}
\end{itemize}

% has this:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_5.tex}

% which is called from:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_6.tex}

% which in turn is called from:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_7.tex}

% which is finally called from inside:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/view/entrypoint.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/view/entrypoint.ts}
\end{itemize}

% in
% \texttt{NgModuleFactory\_.create()}
% method:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_8.tex}

% Now we’ll return to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/render/api.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/render/api.ts}
\end{itemize}

% and move on to the principal class in the Renderer API,
% \texttt{Renderer2}
% , which is abstract
% and declares the following methods:

% \texttt{Renderer2}
% in full is as follows:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_9.tex}

% Here only the interface is being defined – for actual implementation, refer to the
% various platform renderers in the different platform modules. The renderer is a simple
% abstraction, quite suitable for a variety of rendering engine implementations – from
% the Angular team and third parties.

% Finally is
% \texttt{RendererStyleFlags2}
% defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_10.tex}

% It is used to supply a flag parameter to two of
% \texttt{Renderer2}
% ’s methods:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_11.tex}

\input{5_the_core_package/5_8_0_core_src_debug.tex}

\input{5_the_core_package/5_8_0_core_src_debug.tex}

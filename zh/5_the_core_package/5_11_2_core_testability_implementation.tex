\subsection{Core/Testability Implementation}

% The implementation of the testability feature is in the testability sub-directory, which
% contains two file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item testability.externs.js
  \item testability.ts
\end{itemize}

% Its provides functionality for testing Angular components, and includes use of
% \texttt{NgZone}
% .

% \texttt{GetTestability}
% is simply defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_11_2_0.tex}

% \texttt{setTestabilityGetter}
% is used to set the getter:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_11_2_1.tex}

% The
% \texttt{TestabilityRegistry}
% class is “A global registry of Testability instances for
% specific elements”.
% \texttt{TestabilityRegistry}
% maintains a map from any element to an
% instance of a testability. It provides a
% \texttt{registerApplication()}
% method which allows
% an entry to be added to this map, and a
% \texttt{getTestability()}
% method that is a lookup:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_11_2_2.tex}

% The
% \texttt{Testability}
% class is structured as follows:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_11_2_3.tex}

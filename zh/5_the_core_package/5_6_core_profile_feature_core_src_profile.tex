% \emph{“The Web Tracing Framework is a collection of libraries, tools, and scripts}
% \emph{aimed at web developers trying to write large, performance-sensitive}
% \emph{Javascript applications. It's designed to be used in conjunction with the}
% \emph{built-in development tools of browsers but goes far beyond what they}
% \emph{usually support at the cost of some user setup time.”}
% \emph{from:}
% \emph{http://google.github.io/tracing-framework/overview.html}

% Its github project is here:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/google/tracing-framework}
\end{itemize}

% wtf\_impl.ts define the following interfaces:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_6_0.tex}

% It maintains two variables:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_6_1.tex}

% It defines some functions to work with those variables:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_6_2.tex}

% Finally it has a
% \texttt{detectWtf}
% function:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_6_3.tex}

% The profile.ts file exports WTF-related variables:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_6_4.tex}

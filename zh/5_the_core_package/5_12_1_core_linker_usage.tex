\subsection{Core/Linker Usage}

% core/Linker is really the base API for compilation and linking, but we will see these
% types being used elsewhere (in particular, in the Angular Compiler package). The
% source files in the Core/Linker feature are only a few hundred lines of code in total.
% The heavy lifting of compilation is done in the Compiler package, which is much, much
% larger. For example, a single one of its file, view\_compiler.ts, is over a thousand lines
% long. We also see Core/Linker being used by the Compiler-CLI package, which is a
% command-line interface to the Compiler package.

% The
% \texttt{SystemJsNgModuleLoader}
% class is used in the router module, to define the
% \texttt{ROUTER\_PROVIDERS}
% array. The
% \url{router/src/router_module.ts}
% file has this:

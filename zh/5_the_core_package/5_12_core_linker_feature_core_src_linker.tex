\section{Core/Linker Feature (core/src/linker)}

% The Core/Linker feature is used to define an API for the template compiler and is
% instrumental in how compiled components work together.

% When developers new to Angular hear about the linker, their mind immediately races
% to the conclusion that it is something like the C linker or linkers for other languages,
% but that is far from the case with Angular’s linker. Remember Angular is dealing with
% template syntax (a quasi-HTML representation of a page which includes embedded
% TypeScript logic) and this needs to work with component code written in TypeScript.
% So conceptually the angular linker is bringing different parts of your application
% together (so using the term “linker” is technically correct), but in practice how it works
% is quite different to what happens with an ANSI C linker.

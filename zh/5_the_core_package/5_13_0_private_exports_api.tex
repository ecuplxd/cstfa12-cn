\subsection{Private Exports API}

The Core/View feature is not intended to be used directly by Angular applications.
Core/View does not export anything as part of the public API to the Core Package. As
we have already discussed,
\url{core/index.ts}
describes the public API for Core, and its
one line content exports
\url{core/public_api.ts}
, which in turn exports
\url{core/src/core.ts}
and
this exports nothing from the view sub-directory (searching for “view” results in no
matches).

Some Core/Linker public exports are of classes which are used as base classes for
types implemented in Core/View. In the file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/linker.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/linker.ts}
\end{itemize}

Your attention is drawn to these lines:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_0_0.tex}

Core/View is intended to be used internally by other Angular packages. Hence we see
its exports being defined as part of these two private export files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/codegen_private_exports.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/codegen\_private\_exports.ts}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/core_private_export.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/core\_private\_export.ts}
\end{itemize}

The first of these has these view-related exports:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_0_1.tex}

The second has these:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_0_2.tex}

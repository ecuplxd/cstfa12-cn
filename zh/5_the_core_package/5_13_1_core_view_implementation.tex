\subsection{Core/View Implementation}

The source file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/view/types.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/view/types.ts}
\end{itemize}

defines helper types used elsewhere in Core/View. Let’s start with
\texttt{ViewContainerData}
which simply extends
\texttt{ViewContainerRef}
and adds an internal
property to record view data for embedded views:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_1_0.tex}

The
\texttt{TemplateData}
interface extends
\texttt{TemplateRef}
and just adds an array of
\texttt{ViewData}
instances:

The source file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/view/refs.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/core/src/view/refs.ts}
\end{itemize}

provides internal implementations of references (refs).

\texttt{ViewContainerRef\_}
(note the trailing \_) implements
\texttt{ViewContainerData}
which in
turn implements the public
\texttt{ViewContainerRef}
.

It takes an
\texttt{ElementData}
for its anchor element in its constructor:

The two create methods are implemented as follows:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_1_3.tex}

We see the difference between them –
\texttt{createEmbeddedView()}
calls
1
the
\texttt{TemplateRef}
’s
\texttt{createEmbeddedView()}
method and inserts
2
the resulting viewRef;
whereas
\texttt{createComponent()}
calls
3
the component factory’s
\texttt{create}
method, and
with the resulting
\texttt{ComponentRef}
, inserts
4
its
\texttt{HostView}
. Note the return type is
different for each create method – the first returns an
\texttt{EmbededViewRef}
whereas the
second returns a
\texttt{ComponentRef}
.

The implementations of
\texttt{insert}
,
\texttt{indexOf}
,
\texttt{remove}
and
\texttt{detach}
result in use of
appropriate view management APIs:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_1_4.tex}

The
\texttt{ComponentRef\_}
concrete class extends
\texttt{ComponentRef}
. Its constructor takes in an
\texttt{ViewRef}
, which is used in the
\texttt{destroy}
method and to set the component’s change
detector ref and host view:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_13_1_5.tex}

The
\texttt{TemplateRef\_}
implementation has a constructor that takes a
\texttt{ViewData}
for the
parent and a
\texttt{NodeDef}
. Its
\texttt{createEmbeddedView}
method returns a new
\texttt{ViewRef\_}
based on those parameters.

\subsection{core/src}

% The core/src directory directly contains many files, which we will group into three
% categories. Firstly, a number of files just export types from equivalently named sub-
% directories. Files that fall into this category include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item change\_detection.ts
  \item core.ts
  \item di.ts
  \item metadata.ts
  \item linker.ts
  \item render.ts
  \item zone.ts
\end{itemize}

% For example, the renderer.ts file is a one-liner that just exports from renderer/api.ts:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_0.tex}

% and zone.ts file is a one-liner that just exports from zone/ng\_zone.ts:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_1.tex}

% Secondly, are files containing what we might call utility functionality:

\begin{itemize}
  \item console.ts
  \item error\_handler.ts
  \item platform\_core\_providers.ts
  \item security.ts
  \item types.ts
  \item util.ts
  \item version.ts
\end{itemize}

% console.ts contains an injectable service used to write to the console:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_2.tex}

% It is listed as an entry in
% \texttt{\_CORE\_PLATFORM\_PROVIDERS}
% in platform\_core\_providers.ts,
% which is used to create platforms.

% error\_handler.ts defines he default error handler and also, in comments, describes
% how you could implement your own.

% platform\_core\_providers.ts defines
% \texttt{\_CORE\_PLATFORM\_PROVIDERS}
% which lists the core
% providers for dependency injection:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_3.tex}

% It also defines the
% \texttt{platformCore}
% const, used when creating platforms:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_4.tex}

% security.ts defines the
% \texttt{SecurityContext}
% enum:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_5.tex}

% and the
% \texttt{Sanitizer}
% abstract class:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_6.tex}

% The third category of source files directly in the src directory are files related to
% platform- and application-initialization. These include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item application\_init.ts
  \item application\_module.ts
  \item application\_tokens.ts
  \item application\_ref.ts
\end{itemize}

% The first three of these are small (50-70 lines of code), whereas application\_ref.ts is
% larger at over 500 lines.

% Let’s start with application\_tokens.ts. It contains one provider definition and a set of
% opaque tokens for various uses.
% \texttt{PLATFORM\_INITIALIZER}
% is an opaque token that
% Angular itself and application code can use to register supplied functions that will be
% executed when a platform is initialized:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_7.tex}

% An example usage within Angular is in platform-browser:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-browser/src/browser.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-browser/src/browser.ts}
\end{itemize}

% where it is used to have
% \texttt{initDomAdapter}
% function called upon platform initialization
% (note use of
% \texttt{multi}
% – which means multiple such initializer functions can be
% registered):

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_8.tex}

% \texttt{INTERNAL\_BROWSER\_PLATFORM\_PROVIDERS}
% is used a few lines later in browser.ts to
% create the browser platform (and so is used by most Angular applications):

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_9.tex}

% Another opaque token in application\_tokens.ts is
% \texttt{PACKAGE\_ROOT\_URL}
% - used to
% discover the application’s root directory.

% The provider definition identified by
% \texttt{APP\_ID}
% supplies a function that generates a
% unique string that can be used as an application identifier.

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_10.tex}

% A default implementation is supplied, that uses
% \texttt{Math.random}
% and this is then used to
% create an
% \texttt{APP\_ID\_RANDOM\_PROVIDER}
% :

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_11.tex}

% application\_init.ts defines one opaque token and one injectable service. The opaque
% token is:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_12.tex}

% \texttt{APP\_INITIALIZER}
% Its role is similar to
% \texttt{PLATFORM\_INITIALIZER}
% , except it is called
% when an application is initialized. The injectable service is
% \texttt{ApplicationInitStatus}
% ,
% which returns the status of executing app initializers:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_13.tex}

% We will soon see how it is used in application\_ref.ts.

% application\_module.ts defines the
% \texttt{ApplicationModule}
% class:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_14.tex}

% Providers are supplied to Angular’s dependency injection system. The
% \texttt{IterableDiffers}
% and
% \texttt{KeyValueDiffers}
% provides related to change detection.
% \texttt{ViewUtils}
% is defined in the src/linker sub-directory and contains utility-style code
% related to rendering.

% The types in application\_ref.ts plays a pivotal role in how the entire Angular
% infrastructure works. Application developers wishing to learn how Angular really works
% are strongly encouraged to carefully study the code in application\_ref.ts. Let’s start
% our examination by looking at the
% \texttt{createPlatformFactory()}
% function:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_15.tex}

% It takes three parameters –
% 1
% \texttt{parentPlatformFactory}
% ,
% 2
% \texttt{name}
% and an
% 3
% array of
% providers. It returns
% 4
% a factory function, that when called, will return a
% \texttt{PlatformRef}
% .

% This factory function first creates an opaque token
% 5
% to use for DI lookup based on the
% supplied name; then it calls
% \texttt{getPlatform()}
% to see if a platform already exists (only
% one is permitted at any one time), and if false is returned, it calls
% 6
% \texttt{createPlatform()}
% , passing in the result of a call to
% \texttt{ReflectiveInjector}
% ’s
% \texttt{resolveAndCreate}
% (supplied with the providers parameter). Then
% 7
% \texttt{assertPlatform}
% is called with the marker and the result of that call becomes the result of the factory
% function.

% \texttt{PlatformRef}
% is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_16.tex}

% A platform represents the hosting environment within which one or more applications
% execute. Different platforms are supported (e.g. browser UI, web worker, server and
% you can create your own). For a web page, it is how application code interacts with
% the page (e.g. sets URL).
% \texttt{PlatformRef}
% represents the platform, and we see its two
% main features are supplying the root injector and module bootstrapping. The other
% members are to do with destroying resources when no longer needed.

% The supplied implementation of PlatformRef manages the root injector passed in to
% the constructor, an array of
% \texttt{NgModuleRef}
% s and an array of destroy listeners. In the
% constructor,  it takes in an injector. Note that calling the platform’s
% \texttt{destroy()}
% method
% will result in all applications that use that platform having their
% \texttt{destroy()}
% methods
% called.

% The two bootstrapping methods are
% \texttt{bootstrapModule}
% and
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory}
% .
% An important decision for any Angular application team is to decide when to use the
% runtime compilation and when to use offline compilation. Runtime compilation is
% simpler to use and is demonstrated in the
% \url{QuickstartonAngular.io}
% . Runtime
% compilation makes the application bigger (the template compiler needs to run in the
% browser) and is slower (template compilation is required before the template can be
% used). Applications that use runtime compilation need to call
% \texttt{bootstrapModule}
% .
% Offline compilation involves extra build time configuration and so is a little more
% complex to set up, but due to its performance advantages is likely to be used for large
% production applications. Applications that use offline compilation need to call
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory()}
% .

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_17.tex}

% \texttt{bootstrapModule}
% first calls
% 1
% the template compiler and then
% 2
% calls
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory}
% , so after the extra runtime compilation step, both
% bootstrapping approaches follow the same code path.

% When examining zones we already looked at the use of zones within
% \texttt{bootstrapModuleFactory}
% d- other important code there includes the construction of
% \texttt{moduleRef}
% 1
% and the call to
% 2
% \texttt{\_moduleDoBootstrap(moduleRef)}
% :

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_18.tex}

% It is in
% \texttt{\_moduleDoBootstrap}
% that we see the actual bootstrapping taking place:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_19.tex}

% In addition to bootstrapping functionality, there are a few simple platform-related
% functions in core/src/application\_ref.ts.
% \texttt{createPlatform()}
% creates a platform ref
% instance, or more accurately, as highlighted in the code, asks the injector for a
% platform ref and then calls the initializers:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_20.tex}

% Only a single platform may be active at any one time.
% \texttt{\_platform}
% is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_21.tex}

% The
% \texttt{getPlatform()}
% function is simply defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_22.tex}

% The
% \texttt{assertPlatform()}
% function ensures two things, and if either false, throws an
% error. Firstly it ensures that a platform exists, and secondly that its injector has a
% provider for the token specified as a parameter.

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_23.tex}

% The
% \texttt{destroyPlatform()}
% function calls the
% \texttt{destroy}
% method for the platform:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_24.tex}

% The run mode specifies whether the platform is is production mode or developer
% mode. By default, it is in developer mode:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_25.tex}

% This can be set by calling
% \texttt{enableProdMode()}
% :

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_26.tex}

% To determine which mode is active, call
% \texttt{isDevMode()}
% . This always returns the same
% value. In other words, whatever mode is active when this is first call, that is the mode
% that is always active.

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_27.tex}

% \texttt{ApplicationRef}
% is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_28.tex}

% It main method is
% \texttt{bootstrap()}
% , which is a generic method with a type parameter -
% which attaches the component to DOM elements and sets up the application for
% execution. Note that bootstrap’s parameter is a union type, it represents either a
% \texttt{ComponentFactory}
% or a
% \texttt{Type}
% , both of which take C as a type parameter.

% One implementation of
% \texttt{ApplicationRef}
% is supplied, called
% \texttt{ApplicationRef\_}
% . This is
% marked as
% \texttt{Injectable()}
% . It maintains the following fields:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_29.tex}

% Its constructor shows what it needs from an injector and sets up the observables
% (code here is abbreviated):

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_30.tex}

% Its
% \texttt{bootstrap()}
% implementation passes some code to the run function (to run in the
% zone) and this code calls
% \texttt{componentFactory.create()}
% to create the component and
% then
% \texttt{\_loadComponent()}
% .

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_31.tex}

% \texttt{\_loadComponent()}
% is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_32.tex}

% Attached views are those that can be attached to a view container and are subject to
% dirty checking. Such views can be attached and detached, and an array of attached
% views is recorded.

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_3_0_33.tex}

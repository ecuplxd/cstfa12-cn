\section{Core/View Feature (core/src/view)}

% The Core/View feature provides view management functionality. In Angular
% terminology, a view is an area of screen that can display content and where user
% events can be detected. A view is a bundle of elements. Views can be arranged
% hierarchically via the use of View Containers.

% explains the relationship between elements and views:

% \emph{“A View is a fundamental building block of the application UI. It is the}
% \emph{smallest grouping of elements which are created and destroyed together.}

% \emph{Properties of elements in a View can change, but the structure (number and}
% \emph{order) of elements in a View cannot. Changing the structure of Elements can}
% \emph{only be done by inserting, moving or removing nested Views via a}
% \emph{ViewContainerRef. Each View can contain many View Containers.”}

% One could say views are the heart of an Angular application. Core/View is a
% substantial feature that represents over a third of the entire Core package source
% tree.

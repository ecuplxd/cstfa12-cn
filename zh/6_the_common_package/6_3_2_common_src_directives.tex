\subsection{common/src/directives}

% This directory has the following source files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item index.ts
  \item ng\_class.ts
  \item ng\_component\_outlet.ts
  \item ng\_for\_of.ts
  \item ng\_if.ts
  \item ng\_plural.ts
  \item ng\_style.ts
  \item ng\_switch.ts
  \item ng\_template\_outlet.ts
\end{itemize}

% The indexs.ts file exports the directive types:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_0.tex}

% along with a definition for
% \texttt{COMMON\_DIRECTIVES}
% , which is:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_1.tex}

% The various ng\_ files implement the directives. Lets take a peek at one example,
% ng\_if.ts. It uses a view container to create an embedded view based on a template
% ref, if the supplied condition is true. We first see in its constructor it records the view
% container and template ref passed in as parameter:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_2.tex}

% We observe that the
% \texttt{NgIf}
% class does not derive from any other class. It is made into a
% directive by using the
% \texttt{Directive}
% decorator.

% Then we see it has some setters defined as input properties, for the variations of if:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_3.tex}

% Finally it has an internal method,
% \texttt{\_updateView}
% , where the view is changed as needed:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_4.tex}

% The important calls here are (
% 1
% \&
% 2
% ) to
% \texttt{this.\_viewContainer.createEmbeddedView}
% ,
% where the embedded view is created if the
% \texttt{NgIf}
% condition is true.

% If
% \texttt{NgIf}
% creates an embedded view zero or once, then we expect
% \texttt{NgFor}
% to create
% embedded view zero or more times, depends on the count supplied to
% \texttt{NgFor}
% . We see
% this is exactly the case, when we look at
% \url{ng_for_of.ts}
% , which implements the
% \texttt{NgFor}
% class (and a helper class -
% \texttt{NgForOfContext}
% ). The helper class is implemented as:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_5.tex}

% \texttt{NgFor}
% is defined as:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_6.tex}

% The first thing to note about
% \texttt{NgFor}
% â€™s implementation is the class implements
% \texttt{DoCheck}
% and
% \texttt{OnChanges}
% lifecycle. The
% \texttt{DoCheck}
% class is a lifecycle hook defined in
% @angular/core/src/metadata/lifecycle\_hooks.ts as:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_7.tex}

% \texttt{OnChanges}
% is defined in the same file as:

\input{6_the_common_package/code/6_3_2_8.tex}

% Hence we would expect
% \texttt{NgFor}
% to provide
% \texttt{ngDoCheck}
% and
% \texttt{ngOnChanges}
% methods and it
% does.
% \texttt{ngDoCheck()}
% calls
% \texttt{\_applyChanges}
% , where for each change operation a call to
% \texttt{viewContainer.createEmbeddedView()}
% is made.

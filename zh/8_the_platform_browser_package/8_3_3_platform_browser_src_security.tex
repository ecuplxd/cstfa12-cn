\subsection{Platform-browser/src/security}

This directory contains this file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item dom\_sanitization\_service.ts
\end{itemize}

Security sanitizers help prevent the use of dangerous constructs in HTML, CSS styles
and URLs. Sanitizers are configured in the BrowserModule class via an
\texttt{NgModule}
setting. This is the relevant extract from platform-browser/src/browser.ts:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_0.tex}

The dom\_sanitization\_service.ts file declares a range of
\texttt{safeXYZ}
interfaces,
implementation classes for them, the
\texttt{DomSanitizer}
class and the
\texttt{DomSanitizerImpl}
class. It starts by importing the
\texttt{SecurityContext}
enum and
\texttt{Sanitizer}
abstract class
from Core:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/sanitization/security.ts}
        {<ANGULAR\_MASTER>/packages/core/src/sanitization/security.ts}
\end{itemize}

Let’s recall they are defined as:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_1.tex}

In dom\_sanitization\_service.ts the safe marker interfaces are declared as:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_2.tex}

The
\texttt{DomSanitizer}
abstract class implements Core’s
\texttt{Sanitizer}
class. Do read the
large comment at the beginning – you really do not want to be bypassing security if at
all possible.

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_3.tex}

The
\texttt{DomSanitizerImpl}
injectable class is what is supplied to NgModule:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_4.tex}

It can be divided into three sections, the
\texttt{checkNotSafeValue}
method, the sanitize
method and the
\texttt{bypassSecurityTrustXYZ}
methods. The
\texttt{checkNotSafeValue}
method
throws an error is the value parameter is an instance of
\texttt{SafeValueImpl}
:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_5.tex}

The
\texttt{sanitize}
method switches on the
\texttt{securityContext}
enum parameter, if it is
\texttt{NONE}
, then value is simply returned, otherwise additional checking is carried out,
which varies depending on the security context:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_6.tex}

The
\texttt{bypassSecurityTrust}
methods returns an appropriate
\texttt{SafeImpl}
instance:

\input{8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_3_3_7.tex}

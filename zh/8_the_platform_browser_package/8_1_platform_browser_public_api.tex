\section{Platform-Browser Public API}

% The platform-browser API can be sub-divided into these functional areas:
% browser-related, DOM and security.
% code
% Platform
% One platform / one or more applications

% The DOM related API can be represented as:

% Hammer is for touch input.
% \texttt{EventManager}
% handles the flow of events.

% Some important classes â€“ e.g.
% \texttt{DomAdapter}
% - are not publically exported. Instead, they
% are registered with the dependency injector and that is how they are made available
% to application code (we will shortly examine both in detail).

% The browser-related API can be represented as:

% This covers the
% \texttt{NgModule}
% , the
% \texttt{createPlatformFactory}
% function, location information,
% a title helper class, and functions to enable and disable debug tooling.
% BrowserModule
% Platform-Browser Public API (browser-related)

% The security-related API can be represented as:

% The root directory of this package has:

\begin{itemize}
  \item index.ts
\end{itemize}

% which has the single line:

\input{../output/8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_1_0.tex}

% and this in turn has:

\input{../output/8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_1_1.tex}

% If we look at src/platform-browser.ts, we see the exported API of the Platform-
% Browser package:

\input{../output/8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_1_2.tex}

% The private\_export.ts file exports types that are intended to be used by other Angular
% packages and not be normal Angular applications. It has this content:

\input{../output/8_the_platform_browser_package/code/8_1_3.tex}

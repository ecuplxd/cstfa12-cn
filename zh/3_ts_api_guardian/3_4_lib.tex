\section{lib}

% The lib sub-directory contains these files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item cli.ts – command-line interface, processes argument list and invokes commands
  \item main.ts – main logic for generating and verifying golden files
  \item serializer.ts – code to serialize an API (to create the contents of a golden file)
\end{itemize}

% A golden file is a textual representation of an API and the two key tasks of ts-api-
% guardian is to either create or verify golden files based on supplied command line
% arguments.

% Cli.ts starts with some useful comments about how to call ts-api-guardian:

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_4_0.tex}

% cli.ts accepts the following command line options:

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_4_1.tex}

% The Angular API allows annotations to be attached to each API indicating whether it is
% stable, deprecated or experiemental. The
% \texttt{onStabilityMissing}
% option indicates what
% action is required if such an annotation is missing. The
% \texttt{startCli()}
% function parses
% the command line and initializes an instance of
% \texttt{SerializationOptions}
% , and then for
% generation mode calls
% \texttt{generateGoldenFile()}
% or for verification mode calls
% \texttt{verifyAgainstGoldenFile()}
% - both are in main.ts and are actually quite short
% functions:

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_4_2.tex}

% generateGoldenFile calls publicApi (from Serializer.ts) to generate the contents of the
% golden file and then writes it to a file.  VerifyAgainstGoldenFile() also calls publicApi
% and saves the result in a string called actual, and then loads the existing golden file
% data into a string called expected, and then compares then. If then are different, it
% calls createPatch (from the diff package), to create a representation of the differences
% between the actual and expected golden files.

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_4_3.tex}

% serializer.ts defines
% \texttt{SerializationOptions}
% which has three optional properties:

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_4_4.tex}

% Serializer.ts defines a public API function which just calls
% \texttt{publicApiInternal()}
% ,
% which in turn calls
% \texttt{ResolvedDeclarationEmitter()}
% , which is a 200-line class where
% the actual work is performed. It has three methods which perform the serialization:

\begin{itemize}
  \item emit(): string
  \item private getResolvedSymbols(sourceFile: ts.SourceFile): ts.Symbol[]
  \item emitNode(node: ts.Node)
\end{itemize}

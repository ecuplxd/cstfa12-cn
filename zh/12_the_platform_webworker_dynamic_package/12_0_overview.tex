\section{Overview}

% Platform-WebWorkers-Dynamic is the smallest of all the Angular packages. It define
% one const,
% \texttt{platformWorkerAppDynamic}
% , which is a call to
% \texttt{createPlatformFactory()}
% .

% The reason to manage this as a separate package is this one line from package.json:

\input{12_the_platform_webworker_dynamic_package/code/12_0_0.tex}

% It brings in the runtime compiler, which is quite large. We wish to avoid this if it not
% used (it is not needed in the non-dynamic packages, which use the offline compiler).

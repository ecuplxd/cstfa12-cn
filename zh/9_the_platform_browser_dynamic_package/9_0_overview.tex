\section{Overview}

% The term “dynamic” essentially means use the runtime template compiler and its
% absence means use the offline template compiler.

% When Angular applications are bootstrapping they need to supply a platform. Those
% applications that wish to use runtime template compilation will need to supply a
% platform from Platform-Browser-Dynamic. If the application is to run in the browser’s
% main thread the platform to use is
% \texttt{platformBrowserDynamic}
% . If the application is to
% run in a web worker, then the platform to use is
% \texttt{platformWorkerAppDynamic}
% from the
% Platform-WebWorker-Dynamic package (discussed in a later chapter).

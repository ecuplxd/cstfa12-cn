* - [MicroTask] queue represents a set of tasks which are executing right
*   after the current stack frame becomes clean and before a VM yield. All
*   [MicroTask]s execute in order of insertion before VM yield and the next
*   [MacroTask] is executed.
* - [MacroTask] queue represents a set of tasks which are executed one at a
*   time after each VM yield. The queue is ordered by time, and insertions
*   can happen in any location.
* - [EventTask] is a set of tasks which can at any time be inserted to the
*   end of the [MacroTask] queue. This happens when the event fires.

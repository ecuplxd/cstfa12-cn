\subsection{Project Information}

The homepage + root of the source tree for Zone.js are in the main Angular repo at:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/zone.js}
\end{itemize}

Below we assume you have got the Zone.js source tree downloaded locally under a
directory we will call <ZONE-MASTER> and any pathnames we use will be relative to
that. We also will look at the Angular code that calls Zone.js and we use the
<ANGULAR-MASTER> as the root of that source tree.

Zone.js is written in TypeScript. It has no package dependencies (its package.json has
this entry:
\texttt{"dependencies": {}}
), though it has many
\texttt{devDependencies}
. It is quite a
small source tree, whose size (uncompressed) is about 3 MB.

\section{Source Tree Layout}

The Zone.js source tree consists of a root directory with a number of files and the
following immediate sub-directories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item dist
  \item doc
  \item example
  \item scripts
  \item tests
\end{itemize}

The main source is in lib:

\begin{itemize}
  \item lib
\end{itemize}

During compilation the source gets built into a newly created build directory.

/**
 * DomSanitizer helps preventing Cross Site Scripting Security bugs (XSS) by
 * sanitizing values to be safe to use in the different DOM contexts.
 *
 * For example, when binding a URL in an `<a [href]="someValue">` hyperlink,
 * `someValue` will be sanitized so that an attacker cannot inject e.g. a
 * `javascript:` URL that would execute code on the website.
 *
 * In specific situations, it might be necessary to disable sanitization, for
 * example if the application genuinely needs to produce a `javascript:`
 * style link with a dynamic value in it. Users can bypass security by
 * constructing a value with one of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` methods, and
 * then binding to that value from the template.
 *
 * These situations should be very rare, and extraordinary care must be taken
 * to avoid creating a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security bug!
 *
 * When using `bypassSecurityTrust...`, make sure to call the method as early
 * as possible and as close as possible to the source of the value, to make
 * it easy to verify no security bug is created by its use.
 *
 * It is not required (and not recommended) to bypass security if the value
 * is safe, e.g. a URL that does not start with a suspicious protocol, or an
 * HTML snippet that does not contain dangerous code. The sanitizer leaves
 * safe values intact.
 *
 * @security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables
 * Angular's built-in sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check
 * and audit all values and code paths going into this call. Make sure any
 * user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.
 * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](http://g.co/ng/security).

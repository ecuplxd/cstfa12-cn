\chapter{The Common/HTTP Sub-package}

The Common/Http sub-package provides client-side access to an HTTP stack with
configurable HTTP backends (e.g. alternatives for test). For production use, it usually
makes calls to the browser’s
\texttt{XmlHttpRequest()}
function.

Note that in ealier versions of Angular, HTTP was a top-level package (similar to core,
common, router, forms) but in recent versions of Angular it has been moved to be a
sub-package of Common. Be aware that in older books, blogs and code samples you
will still find references to this older top-level HTTP package. You will also find its API
still described in the Angular API documentation, with all its types marekd as
“deprecated”. For new code you write it is recommended to use the Common/HTTP
sub-package and that is what we describe here.

An interesting additional project called in-memory-web-api can be used for a test-
friendly implementation. It is located here:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api}
\end{itemize}

This can work with the new Common/HTTP sub-package or the older HTTP top-level
package. The link about describes how to set up each – make sure it is appropriate for
your needs. A very important note on that page is:

\emph{Always import the HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule after the}
\emph{HttpClientModule to ensure that the in-memory backend provider}
\emph{supersedes the Angular version.}

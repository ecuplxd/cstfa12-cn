\section{Source Tree}

The root directory contains these files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item gulpfile.js
  \item package.json
  \item tsconfig.json
  \item tsd.json
\end{itemize}

and these top-level directories:

\begin{itemize}
  \item bin
  \item lib
  \item test
\end{itemize}

The primary tasks in the gulpfile are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item compile
  \item test.compile
  \item test.unit
  \item watch
\end{itemize}

The unit tests are based on mocha (unlike most of the rest of Angular, which uses
jasmine).

The package.json has the following dependencies:

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_2_0.tex}

The most important of these is the diff package, which is used to determine
differences between blocks of text (
\url{https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff}
).

Package.json also list the single callable program inside ts-api-guardian:

\input{3_ts_api_guardian/code/3_2_1.tex}

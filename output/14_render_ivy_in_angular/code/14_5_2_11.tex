/**
 * The static equivalent of LContainer, used in TContainerNode.
 *
 * The container needs to store static data for each of its embedded views
 * (TViews). Otherwise, nodes in embedded views with the same index as nodes
 * in their parent views will overwrite each other, as they are in
 * the same template.
 *
 * Each index in this array corresponds to the static data for a certain
 * view. So if you had V(0) and V(1) in a container, you might have:
 *
 * [
 *   [{tagName: 'div', attrs: ...}, null],     // V(0) TView
 *   [{tagName: 'button', attrs ...}, null]    // V(1) TView
 * ]
 */

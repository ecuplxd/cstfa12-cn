 * LNode is an internal data structure which is used for the incremental DOM

 * (actual rendered DOM node) and our logical representation of DOM nodes,
 * `Lnodes`. The data structure is optimized for speed and size.
 *
 * In order to be fast, all subtypes of `LNode` should have the same shape.
 * Because size of the `LNode` matters, many fields have multiple roles
 * depending on the `LNode` subtype.

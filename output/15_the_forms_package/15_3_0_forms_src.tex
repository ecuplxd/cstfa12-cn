\subsection{forms/src}

The @angular/forms/src directory contains these files:

\begin{itemize}
  \item directives.ts
  \item form\_builder.ts
  \item form\_providers.ts
  \item forms.ts
  \item model.ts
  \item validators.ts
\end{itemize}

forms\_providers.ts defines the
\texttt{FormsModule}
and
\texttt{ReactiveFormsModule}
NgModules as
follows:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_0.tex}

We note the two difference between
\texttt{FormsModule}
and
\texttt{ReactiveFormsModule}
are that
\texttt{ReactiveFormsModule}
has an additional
\texttt{FormBuilder}
provider configuration, and the
export from
\texttt{FormModule}
includes
\texttt{TEMPLATE\_DRIVEN\_DIRECTIVES}
whereas the export
from
\texttt{ReactiveFormsModule}
includes
\texttt{REACTIVE\_DRIVEN\_DIRECTIVES}
.

directives.ts defines these:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_1.tex}

A nice discussion of how to create dynamic forms using
\texttt{REACTIVE\_FORM\_DIRECTIVES}
is here:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/dynamic-form.html}
\end{itemize}

The form\_builder.ts file defines the injectable
\texttt{FormsBuilder}
class, which can
dynamically construct a
\texttt{FormGroup, FormArray}
or
\texttt{FormControl}
via its
\texttt{group()}
,
\texttt{array()}
or
\texttt{control()}
methods. They are defined as:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_2.tex}

The validators.ts file first declares two opaque tokens for dependency injection:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_3.tex}

It also defines the Validators class:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_4.tex}

A sample implementation of one of the validators is:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_5.tex}

The return value
1
is a string to boolean map. If the first line
2
is true, then
{'required': true} is returned
3
, otherwise null
4
is returned.

The model.ts file is large and defines the form control hierarchy:

The status of a form control is one of:
AbstractControl

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_6.tex}

The
\texttt{AbstractControl}
class defines a constructor, that takes in validator and async
validator functions. This class also defines a bunch of getters which map to private
fields. The value field refers to data we wish to strore within the control:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_7.tex}

The
\texttt{\_status}
field refers to the validator checking:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_8.tex}

The
\texttt{\_error}
field returns a map of errors (if any):

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_9.tex}

The
\texttt{\_pristine}
field refers to whether the control’s data has been changed –
\texttt{pristine()}
is true if unchanged, and
\texttt{dirty()}
is true if changed:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_10.tex}

The
\texttt{\_touched}
field refers to whether the user has visited the control (if does not
mean that the control’s value has been changed):

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_11.tex}

There are also two
\texttt{xxChanges()}
getters, for value changes and status changes, that
return observables:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_12.tex}

These are initialized to event emitters via:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_13.tex}

\texttt{AbstractControl}
also declares a function:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_14.tex}

which executes the condition function over the control and its children and return a
boolean. This
\texttt{\_anyControls}
function is used in many helper methods to determine
information about the control, e.g.:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_15.tex}

It has a parent field:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_16.tex}

which is used when the state of the control is being updated.

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_17.tex}

It is set via:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_18.tex}

Its is hierarchical and this is supplied to find the root:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_19.tex}

The FormControl class is supplied for atomic controls (that do not contain any child
controls).

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_20.tex}

Its
\texttt{\_value}
field is set via
\texttt{setValue()}
method which reacts depending on the four
optional booleans supplied:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_21.tex}

It has a
\texttt{reset()}
method to reset control data:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_22.tex}

The FormGroup class extends AbstractControl:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_23.tex}

Its constructor’s first parameter defines a controls associative map (in constrast to
FormArray):

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_24.tex}

Controls can be registered with w FormGroup via:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_25.tex}

The values of all controls in the group may be set via:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_26.tex}

Note it throws an exception is any of the controls are missing
1
.

The FormArray class extends AbstractControl:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_27.tex}

Its constructor’s first parameter is simply an array:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_28.tex}

It allows you to insert at the end of the array or at a given location, and to remove:

\input{15_the_forms_package/code/15_3_0_29.tex}

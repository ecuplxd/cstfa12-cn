The small Zone.js library (
\url{https://github.com/angular/zone.js}
) provides a way of
managing multiple execution contexts when using asynchronous tasks. Angular has a
dependency on it, and we see its use here in core/src/zone.

The ng\_zone.ts file in Angular Core defines the
\texttt{NgZone}
class, which provides an
Angular wrapper for zones. It is defined as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_10_0_0.tex}

Its constructor implementation is worth studying. First note Angular requires Zone.js
and throws an error if it is not found. If
\texttt{wtfZoneSpec}
or
\texttt{longStackTraceZoneSpec}
zones are required, it forks as needed:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_10_0_1.tex}

\subsection{Core/Testability Usage}

We see use of
\texttt{TestabilityRegistry}
in
\url{core/src/platform_core_providers.ts}
by
\texttt{\_CORE\_PLATFORM\_PROVIDERS}
:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_11_1_0.tex}

The bootstrap method in
\texttt{ApplicationRef}
looks for configured
\texttt{Testability}
elements
via dependency injection
1
and if found
2
, then registers them
3
with the
\texttt{TestabilityRegistry}
(which itself is also accessed via dependency injection):

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_11_1_1.tex}

Note there is a class
\texttt{BrowserGetTestability}
in:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/platform-browser/src/browser/testability.ts}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/platform-browser/src/browser/testability.ts}
\end{itemize}

that implements
\texttt{GetTestability}
with a static
\texttt{init()}
method that calls
\texttt{setTestabilityGetter()}
:

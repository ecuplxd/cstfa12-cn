\subsection{core/src/debug}

This directory contains this file:

\begin{itemize}
  \item debug\_node.ts
\end{itemize}

The debug\_node.ts file implements
\texttt{EventListener}
,
\texttt{DebugNode}
and
\texttt{DebugElement}
classes along with some helper functions.
\texttt{EventListener}
stores a name and a
function, to be called after events are detected:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_0.tex}

The
\texttt{DebugNode}
class represents a node in a tree:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_1.tex}

The debug node at attached as a child to the parent
\texttt{DebugNode}
. The
\texttt{nativeNode}
to
which this
\texttt{DebugNode}
refers to is recorded. A private field,
\texttt{\_debugContext}
records
supplies additional debugging context. It is of type
\texttt{DebugContext}
, defined in
view/types.ts as:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_2.tex}

The
\texttt{DebugElement}
class extends
\texttt{DebugNode}
and supplies a debugging representation
of an element.

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_3.tex}

It includes these for adding and removing children:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_4.tex}

It includes this for events:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_5.tex}

The functions manage a map:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_6.tex}

This is used to add a node:

\input{5_the_core_package/code/5_8_0_7.tex}

\section{Router API}

The exported API of the Angular Router package can be represented as:

The Angular Router source tree is at:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/packages/router}
        {<ANGULAR-MASTER>/packages/router}
\end{itemize}

Its root directory contains index.ts, which just exports the contents of public\_api.ts,
which in turn exports the contents of .src/index.ts.

This lists the exports and gives an initial impression of the size of the router package:

\input{13_the_router_package/code/13_1_0.tex}

It also has the line:

\input{13_the_router_package/code/13_1_1.tex}

As already discussed, such private exports are intended for other packages within the
Angular Framework itself, and not to be directly used by Angular applications. The
private\_export.ts file has these exports (note names are prepended with ’ ’);
ɵ

\input{13_the_router_package/code/13_1_2.tex}

\section{Target Audience}

This guided tour of the Angular source tree is aimed at intermediate to advanced
application developers who wish to develop a deeper understanding of how Angular
actually works. To really appreciate the functioning of Angular, an application
developer should read the source. Yes, Angular come with developer documentation
at
\url{https://angular.io/docs}
(which is mostly quite good) but it is best studied in
conjunction with the source code.
